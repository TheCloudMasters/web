                                text: While many platforms claim no-code or low-code capabilities, they often cater to specific industries or imposing rigid features and menus. The typical development journey on these platforms starts smoothly and quickly achieves 80 percent of a build, struggles with the next 10 percent, but soon hits roadblocks in the last 10 percent that can’t be bypassed due to the abstraction. ues.io disrupts this by offering an inherently extendable platform. This unique feature allows developers to seamlessly integrate custom code, ensuring all functionalities are within reach. The platform eradicates the notorious bottleneck of the ‘10 percent gap’ in traditional no-code/low-code platforms.
